<td>Organization day Our booth was filled with energy, enthusiasm, and wonder. Safe to say that Organization Day 2025 was a success!

We were beyond thrilled to see so many students showing interest in the world of science, asking questions, exploring new ideas, and discovering the why behind our organization.</td>
